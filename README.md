# slice-jump

This is a fairly minimal Vagrant project for spinning up a jump host in SLICE
(Puppet's internal OpenStack) that also has Vagrant (and the vagrant-openstack-provider plugin) installed and other useful things such as:
- mosh (mobile shell)
- tmux
- bind-utils (host, nslookup)
- mtr

```
  Mac / Vagrant ----> SLICE VM / Vagrant ----> SLICE whatever project
```

## Using

There's a bunch of shell environment variables you'll need to set up first. There's an example set of them in `slice.rc`. You may want to download your slice.rc from the SLICE UI, or copy and modify the example in this repo.

Source the rc file:

```
source slice.rc
```

When prompted, provide your PuppetPass password.

In the Vagrantfile you'll see that the slicejump host is being created in network0. You may want to change this if you want your slicejump host in some special network you may have created.

Creation:

```
vagrant up
```

Discover the SSH configuration (including floating IP of your new host):

```
vagrant ssh-config
```

Moshing in (alternative to ssh):
- ensure mosh is installed on your Mac or whatever your laptop / desktop is running - https://mosh.org/ (eg `brew install mosh`)
- `mosh --ssh "ssh -i ~/.ssh/slice.pem" ubuntu@IP_ADDR_OF_VM` (replace `IP_ADDR_OF_VM` with the IP of the VM)
- start up a tmux session `tmux` (or `tmux a` to reconnect to a previous tmux session)

## Caveats

- I set up a .tmux.conf file for user ubuntu which rebinds the tmux prefix to ctrl-a (default is ctrl-b in tmux, who knows why)
- I'm using the **puppet apply** provisioner and everything is done in one file at `puppet/environments/production/manifests/default.pp` - buy me a VB
- Puppet modules have been vendored into `puppet/environments/production/modules/` for reliability, speed, and simplicity

## Why?

Using Vagrant to interact with SLICE via the vagrant-openstack-provider plugin over the VPN from Australia is woefully slow. It can take minutes to get through the intial proceedings of authenticating to OpenStack and whatever else the openstack provider does before actually spinning up vms or anything else useful. I have a theory that this is due to the network latency between Australia and Portland, OR (around 200 ms on a good day) so I've created this project to encapsulate the task of setting up a host within SLICE with which to control SLICE from for my other projects. It will probably also come in handy as a jump host to access my other SLICE hosted vms from, etc.

## How?

vagrant-openstack-provider creates a Linux vm (Ubuntu currently as it includes a package for mosh)

Vagrant's shell provisioner then ensures that:
- Puppet's package repo for puppet-collections 1 is configured
- puppet-agent package is installed
- Probably 2 cores and 2 GB RAM is overkill for what this VM does.

Vagrant's puppet provisioner then takes over configuration and installs a bunch of packages, including Vagrant, tmux, etc.

## To Do

- Add gcc, make and other build tools?
- Pass through SLICE credentials somehow, maybe
